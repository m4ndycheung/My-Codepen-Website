                <p>Hi my name is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJI0jOQUOIg&t=15s" target="_blank"><span class="strike">Jonaaas</span></a> Mandy. I was born in England, my family lived a couple of my baby months there, then moved swiftly up to bonnie Scotland. I’ve grown up most of my life in Edinburgh and ended up studying at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow where I now happily reside. </p>
                <p>
                  When I was a kid, I remember being quite the hermit. I was afraid to play with kids in my neighbourhood for fear of name-calling because my family looked different. So, when my dad bought our first Windows PC and I saw him playing Age of Empires, my childish wonder kicked in (especially when I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRL5durPleI" target="_blank">this</a>!) and I knew I had to have a go. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After school, I’d jump on and play the *coolest* games… Solitaire, Minesweeper, Paint, and Microsoft Golf. Eventually my dad installed AOL dial-up broadband and my life changed forever. I started on AOL messenger, played some online bingo then came along Neopets, a web-based game. I also had my first encounter with HTML here (although, I didn’t know that at the time). The internet created so much possibility, I was spoilt. I’d download mods for The Sims, probably downloaded some viruses on Limewire, and had my first taste of MMORPGs.

              I currently work for a small and remote recruitment. I began as an Intern who was pushed towards Sales. I didn't enjoy Sales and quickly
              gravitated towards solving problems with the company's software. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to 2022, I'm now the Operations Coordinator
              which means I wear a good few hats! My skills come in handy for technical and admin support, data and website management, and training people on my team on how to use the CRM and WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love
              working within a small team as I have the flexibility to tinker with our CRM
              behind the scenes. However, I can't see myself staying in
              a job with little career advancement or growth opportunities for the next 5 years.
              This is one of my "Why's" for embarking on a journey into tech.

            <p>
              Why learn to code? Why now? From a young age, the computer and the internet sparked my curiosity and with no tech role models in my life, I didn't pursue this curiosity and instead went to university to study a MEng in Product Design Engineering. I loved learning how products are designed and manufactured, but in the end, a number of barriers made me decide this path was not for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I decided that I want to do something that I'm excited to learn about, talk about and contribute to.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year I decided to take steps towards this decision. I said to myself, you can go to that 16 week bootcamp <span class="small-text">and soon realising no I can’t because it costs </span><span class="smaller-text">£5,000 and was full-time so I’d have to quit my job and somehow pay all my bills...</span><br>So here I am now with CodeYourFuture! I am so grateful to have this free and part-time opportunity and to join this diverse community. I am happy I chose this path.</br>
